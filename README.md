# Vehicle-Security-System-using-Facial-Recognition
This project involves the development of a Vehicle Security System using Facial Recognition, implemented in Python. It integrates cutting-edge facial recognition technology to enhance vehicle security. By employing advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, the system can accurately identify the driver's face, adding an additional layer of security beyond traditional key-based systems. This approach ensures that only authorized individuals can access and operate the vehicle, significantly reducing the risk of theft or unauthorized use. The project leverages Python's robust programming capabilities and libraries like OpenCV for image processing, making it a modern solution for vehicular security challenges. It's an ideal application for those interested in combining AI with automotive security.
